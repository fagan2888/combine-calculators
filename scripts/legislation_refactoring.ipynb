    "# Tax Legislation Refactoring\n",
    "\n",
    "The tax/benefit legislation on individuals in France is more than 200,000 lines long.\n",
    "\n",
    "We believe that with this tool, you can make it less than 100 lines, transparent, and 95% similar to the existing legislation\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define your concepts (e.g., 'nb_enfants', 'age', 'parent isolÃ©') and budget (e.g.: cost less than 2 millions euros)\n",
    "2. The machine learning algorithm helps you adjust the parameters of your reform to approximate the current legislation and fit your budget\n",
    "3. From the biggest discrepencies with the current legislation, you can improve your concepts (or the legislation)\n",
    "4. Repeat until you reach a legislation that matches your own goals. The algorithm takes care of minimizing your budget and maximizing the similarity to current legislation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Beta version limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "For this test, we only take a population of people from all ages, who have 0 to 5 children, no salary, married, veuf, paces, divorces or celibataires, and simulate the \"aides sociales\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Current Results:\n",
    "\n",
    "Within a few minutes, we got a tax reform for \"aides sociales\" for people with no salary that is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 6 lines long \n",
    "* similar to the existing in average at more than 95%\n"
